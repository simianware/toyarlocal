# toyarlocal

First run

```bash
yarn
```

This will install arlocal

Next start the arlocal instance

```bash
npx arlocal 1990
```
This starts the instance of arlocal on port 1990

Next run startserver.js, this is badly named.

```bash
node startserver.js
```

This will make it so files uploaded to the arlocal server are commited every 60 seconds.
